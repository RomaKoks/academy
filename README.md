# Anyscale Academy - Tutorials on Ray and Ray-based Libraries

Â© 2018-2022, Anyscale. All Rights Reserved

Welcome to the [Anyscale Academy](https://anyscale.com/academy) tutorials on [Ray](https://ray.io), the system for scaling your Python and ML applications from a 
laptop to a cluster.

This README tells you how to set up the tutorials and decide which content is best for your interests.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Modules and materials in this Academy have been updated and tested with `Ray release 1.11` and supported `Python 3.8`. Older 
modules and tutorials have been retired into their respective `retired` directories. Hence, current material content will not match
the Ray Summit 2020 tutorial. 

Also, the setup process has been streamlined and Python dependencies and packages reduced.

## Tutorial Setup

Read the appropriate setup section that follows, then jump to [**Launching the Tutorials**](#user-content-launching-the-tutorials).

## Setup for Anyscale Academy Hosted Sessions

There is nothing you need to setup, as the hosted environment will provide everything.

However, consider cloning or downloading a release of the tutorial notebooks and supporting software from 
the [Academy repo](https://github.com/anyscale/academy), so you have a local copy of everything.

> **Tip:** If you modify any notebooks during the hosted session, make sure you download them to save those changes.

## Setup for a Local Machine

> **Note:** Ray support for Windows is new. See [these release notes]() for details.

Follow these instructions to use the tutorials. Note that some commands can take a while to finish.

Clone the [Academy GitHub repo](https://github.com/anyscale/academy) or [download the latest release](https://github.com/anyscale/academy/releases).

Now install the dependencies using either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or `pip` in your Python environment. We recommend using Anaconda.

### Which Python Version?

Python 3.7+ is recommended. While Ray supports Python 3.8, some dependencies used in `RLlib` (the Ray reinforcement library) are not yet 
supported for 3.8, at the time of this writing.

### Using Anaconda

If you need to install Anaconda, follow the instructions [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). If you already have Anaconda installed, consider running `conda upgrade --all`.

Run the following commands in the root directory of this project. First, use `conda` to install the other dependencies, including Ray. Then activate the newly-created environment, named `anyscale-academy`. Finally, run the provided `tools/fix-jupyter.sh` script to install a graphing library extension in Jupyter Lab and perform other tasks.

```shell
conda create -n anyscale-academy python=3.8
conda activate anyscale-academy
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install typing-extensions --upgrade
tools/fix-jupyter.sh
```

If you are using Windows, see the [**Fixing Jupyter Lab on Windows**](#user-content-fixing-jupyter-lab-on-windows) below for an alternative to using `tools/fix-jupyter.sh`.

Note that Python 3.8.is used. Ignore the similar-looking `environment-docker.yml` file. It is used to build Docker images.

You can delete the environment later with the following command:

```
conda env remove --name anyscale-academy
```

### Using Pip

If you don't use Anaconda, you'll have to install these prerequisites first:

* Python 3.7:
	* See notes above about problems with 3.6 and 3.8. Don't use 3.8, but 3.6 may work for you.
    * The version of Python that comes with your operating system is probably too old. Try `python --version` to see what you have.
    * Installation instructions are at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Pip: A recent version - consider upgrading if it's not the latest version.
	* Installation instructions are at [pip.pypa.io](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
* Node.js: Required for some of the Jupyter Lab graphics extensions we use.
	* Installation instructions are [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* SWIG: Required for building dependencies.
	* Use the package manager of  your system (e.g. `apt` on Ubuntu, `brew` on MacOS) to install, or download [here](http://www.swig.org/download.html).

Next, run the following commands in the root directory of this project to complete the setup. First, run the `pip` command to install the rest of the libraries required for these tutorials, including Ray. Then, run the provided script to install a graphing library extension in Jupyter Lab and perform other tasks.

```shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install typing-extensions --upgrade
tools/fix-jupyter.sh
```

If you are using Windows, see the [**Fixing Jupyter Lab on Windows**](#user-content-fixing-jupyter-lab-on-windows) below for an alternative to using `tools/fix-jupyter.sh`.

### Fixing Jupyter Lab on Windows

The `tools/fix-jupyter.sh` shell script runs the following commands. If you are using Windows, run them yourself as shown here.

First, see if the following `pyviz` extension is installed:

```
jupyter labextension check --installed "@pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz"
```

If not, run this command:

```
jupyter labextension install "@pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz"
```

Finally, run these commands:

```
jupyter labextension update --all
jupyter lab build
jupyter labextension list
```

> **Note:** A Windows and Mac M1 version are experimental in Ray 1.8.

## Launching the Tutorials

The previous steps installed [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), the notebook-based environment we'll use for all the lessons. 
To start run the following command in the project root directory:

```shell
jupyter lab
```

It should automatically open a browser window with the lab environment, but if not, the console output will show the URL you should use.

> **Tip:** If you get an error that `jupyter` can't be found and you are using the Anaconda setup, make sure you activated the `anyscale-academy` 
> environment, as shown above.
