    "## About This Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial, part of [Anyscale Academy](https://anyscale.com/academy), introduces _hyperparameter tuning_, often called _hyperparameter optimization_ for which we'll use the acronym _HPO_ (since \"hyperparameter\" is often spelled \"hyper parameter\"). \n",
    "\n",

    "See the instructions in the [README](../README.md) for setting up your environment to use this tutorial.\n",
