    "\n",
    "![Ray Train](../images/RaySGD.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray Train, formerly known as Ray SGD, is a lightweight library for distributed deep learning, allowing you to scale up and speed up training for your deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ease of use**: Scale your single process training code to a cluster in just a couple lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composability**: Ray Train interoperates with Ray Tune to tune your distributed model and Ray Datasets to train on large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactivity**: Ray Train fits in your workflow with support to run from any environment, including seamless Jupyter notebook support.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the instructions in the [README](../README.md) for setting up your environment to use this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
